			<h2>Step 1: Identify and Create a Topic.</h2>
				<p> First and foremost, there is always a matter, issue, or subject analyzed and examined in a research paper. For starters, you must always begin by determining the subject. Select one that best interests you and one you especially want to talk about.</p>

			<h2>Step 2: Look for Information.</h2>
				<p id="two p"> After identifying your chosen topic, try to check if you have enough resources available. If that's the case, you may continue and start by specifying which materials to use for your research. Otherwise, it would be much more difficult to continue with little information. 

As the internet is very prevalent nowadays, search engines are more advanced. So, by using search engines, such as Google, Firefox, etc. it would be easier to locate the references required. We have a recommended list of websites down below for you to check out! Here is also a video that may help you choose which type of source you want to use.</p>

			<h2>Step 3: Analyze the Given Information.</h2>
				<p> Once you have located the resources you're going to use, assess if it has credible and reliable data. Evidence and facts are necessary as they are utilized in every research paper, so it is an important detail to take note of. The attached video helps as a guide for finding out whether or not the information is conceivable.</p>

			<h2>Step 4: Organize the Information and Write the Paper.</h2>
				<p> Begin by writing a draft or outline to help organize your ideas, revise and edit your draft, and ultimately, create the final product. The succeeding photos presented are examples of an outline.</p>

			<h2>Step 5: Cite Sources and Proofread.</h2>
				<p> And finally! The last step of the process is citing your sources properly and proofreading the paper you have created. Ensure that there are no spelling and grammar mistakes, and cite your references appropriately. The APA and MLA formats are the citations widely employed, and this video will help guide you on how to use them.</p>
