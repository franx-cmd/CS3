			<h2>Step 2: Look for Information.</h2>
				<p id="two p"> After identifying your chosen topic, try to check if you have enough resources available. If that's the case, you may continue and start by specifying which materials to use for your research. Otherwise, it would be much more difficult to continue with little information.</p>
				<p>As the internet is very prevalent nowadays, search engines are more advanced. So, by using search engines, such as Google, Firefox, etc. it would be easier to locate the references required. We have a recommended list of websites down below for you to check out! Here is also a video that may help you choose which type of source you want to use.</p>

			<h2>Step 3: Analyze the Given Information.</h2>

Evidence and facts are necessary as they are utilized in every research paper, so it is an important detail to take note of. The attached video helps as a guide for finding out whether or not the information is conceivable.</p>
