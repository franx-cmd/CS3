			<li> I most especially like the 25th anniversary stage they did for it.</li>
			<li> Their production was monumental! From the clothes, the instruments, and the way they coordinated things.</li>
			<li> I also find it impressive on how high pitched they could sing, while dancing at times too!</li>
